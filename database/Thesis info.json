To grt relevant and related information, efficient Information Reteieval (IR) system which is needed provides advanced searching facilities. To organize large information  repositories efficiently, metadata can be used. Closely related to metadata is ontology.Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse, properties of each concept descripting various feactures and attributes of the concept, and restrictions on slots. This thesis is intented to present the feactures and benefits of the IR system by applying ontology concepts and also point out how metadata is critical in supporting effictive discovery.

The types of the objects can then be recognized or  identified. The object extraction as well as recognition is useful for many different application, such as machine vision, industrial insperation tasks, pick and place operations. Extraction and Recognition of objects from 2D images has been proposed in several methods. For the extraction of the objects from 2D images, among the various extraction methods, component labeling technique is applied in this thesis. For the recognition of a certain object, template maching (historgram matching) technique is applied since the component labeling and template matching methods are simple and effective. The histograms of various objects are previously stored in the histogram database in order to be ready for histogram matching. The histogram of the object in interest is also built up by the system. This histogram has to be matched with the histograms in the histogram database. By means of the template matching technique, the type of the extracted objects has to be recognized.",

A compiler first  analyzes the source program and breaks it into its  constituent parts. Its then synthesizes the object program by using th information gathered during the analysis phase. Syntax analyzer or parser is the second part of the compiler. Parser obtains a string of tokens from lexical analyzer and verifies that string can be generated by the grammar for the source language and produce as output a syntax tree to use for the source language and produce as output a syntax tree to use for semantic analysis. The system will use the parsing techniques. The two parsing methods are top down and  button up  parsing methods.

A multi-agent system is composed of multiple interacting software components known as agents, which are typically capable of cooperating to solve problems that are beyond the abilities of any individual member. Multi-agent systems are important primarily because they have been found to have very wide applicability, in areas as diverse as industrial process control and electronic commerce. This system is based on the multi-agent system to estimate the cost of a specific home building. It includes slave agents that estimate the cost of a specific home type and then send to master agent. Slave agents use cost estimation methods to estimate the budget. Master agent shows the costs of the home from slaves comparatively. As in real world marketplace, this system can negotiate using reverse auction method. The primary goal of this system is to make expertise available to builders of new home who need to buy, with varieties of information quickly. The programming language for implementing this system is ASP.NET (web programming) and Microsoft SQL server 2005 (database programming).

An image-based data requires more effort during encryption and decryption. Encryption involves applying special mathematical algorithms and keys to transform original data into cipher code before original data are transmitted. Decryption involves the application of mathematical algorithms and keys to get back the original data from cipher code. This system applies an approach of block permutation for image encryption. In this technique, the image can be decomposed into blocks. A group of blocks is taken from the image and these blocks are permuted (that are rearranged within the image) with the user-defined key. From the results, the smaller block size should be lower for better encryption. This system is implemented using C# programming and Microsoft SQL Server 2005",

Marketing managers make numerous strategic and tactical decisions in the process of identifying and satisfying customer needs. To make such decisions, they need time, money, people and other resources. Therefore, managers need survey research tools that can predict what customers will choose when faced with the variety of brands available and myriad product characteristics. The system that will be present supports the manager to know which computer brands and attributes are chosen most by using Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis. This system implements the three stages of Choice Based Conjoint Analysis to know the most chosen computer brand and attributes. Firstly, the user of the system must ask questions to the target peoples. And then, the answers data are collected as the second stage. Finally, the data collected in second stage are analyzed. This system also measures the utility of the product; therefore, manager can know how to control the stock level of the existing product and estimate the preferences of customers by using this utility value of the product. This system can analyze market survey data that have already been collected from customers. By using this system, manager can save time, money and other resources to research the preferences of customers.

By moving to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-to-end latency.

This system intends not only sites/shops to publish their product catalogue simultaneously according to the user%u2019s request but also user to find the preferences shop to make his/her purchases. In this system, when the user gives the input, distributed query is processed parallel on each site by using parallel mobile agent. Then, the result which is the product information is returned to user. It not only supports activities of users but also facilitates parallel processing.

The usefulness of binary arithmetic coding (that is, coding with a 2-symbol alphabet) is pointed out, and the modeling issue, particularly high-order modeling for text compression is discussed. The main focus is on encoding, but the decoding process is similar. For each symbol of the file, the current interval is subdivided into subintervals, one for each possible alphabet symbol. The size of a symbol’s subinterval is proportional to the estimated probability that the symbol will be the next symbol in the file, according to the model of the input. The subinterval corresponding to the symbol that actually occurs next in the file is selected, and the new current interval is made. Enough bits are output to distinguish the final current interval from all other possible final intervals. Arithmetic coding is a method for lossless data compression. Normally, a string of characters such as the words ‘hello there’ is represented by using a fixed number of bits per character, as in the ASCII code. Arithmetic coding is a form of variable-length entropy encoding that converts a string into another form that represents frequently used characters using more bits, with the goal of using fewer bits in total.",

In the areas of statistics (mixture models), computer science (Data Mining, machine learning, nearest neighbor search), pattern recognition, and vector quantification, there is still a lot of work being done. This system represents development of clustering system using K-means method. K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. It is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large data sets. It is also simple and fairly fast. K-Means is initialized form some random or approximate solution. Each iteration assigns each point to its nearest cluster and then poiiits belonging to the came cluster are averaged to get new cluster centroids. Each iteration successively improves cluster centroids until they become stable. This system is implemented by K-Means algorithm with Flag data set. According to the use of well known Flag data set, the algorithm has demonstrated a very good classification performance. The accuracy is tested with different k-value. Experiments will show that the algorithm is scalable in terms of both the number of clusters and the number of records.",

      "Abstract" : "In most digital communication systems, whenever error events occur in the transmitted messages, error correction procedure must be taken to correct these events. In some applications where a two-way communication link exists between the sender and the receiver, the receiver may inform the sender that a message has been received in error and, request a repeat of that message. An error control system in which the erroneously received messages are simply retransmitted is called Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). This is an error control technique whereby an error detection scheme is combined with requests for retransmission of erroneous data. Every block of data received is checked by using, the error detection code applied, and if the check fails, retransmission of the data is requested — this may be done repeatedly, until the data can be verified. Error detection is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver. Error correction is the detection of errors and reconstruction of the original, error-free data. This system utilizes Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection and stop-and-wait ARQ technique for error correction.

The Cluster Profile cooperates with the Fading Function. The properties of Cluster Profile are additivity, updatability, and fading. Fading Function keeps an account of the time-dependent importance of the cluster.\n        Before adding the new documents, the system calls the Merge algorithm to set the k cluster according to the fading factor value and check the similarity between them.

This thesis is based on the Natural Language Processing concept. Grammar analysis 15 done with a special Natural Language Processing (NLP) program that converts poor writing to acceptable writing. So special grammar analyzer programs can be used to process business communications and improve them. This thesis deals with the implementation of the grammar checker. The user can input a sentence or paragraph in the limitations of grammar rules and words within the system. But the system can use not only for grammar checking but also for spelling checking. The system works together with the lexicon that has stored words. If the input sentence has the spelling error, the system will give the suggestion for error words. If the input sentence has the grammar error, the system will display the suggestion for grammar error.",

      "Abstract" : "Querying in Natural language is more convenient for the user than querying in SQL. This system is intended to construct the query translation system from Natural Language to SQL. Natural Language Processing is a theoretically motivated range of computational techniques for analyzing and representing naturally occurring texts at one or more levels of linguistic analysis for the purpose of achieving human-like language processing for a range of tasks or applications. If the computer understands the natural language, the computer and user communication will be smarter. Correct translated words of simple sentence can be retrieved because of the limitation of the domain. It is specialized for developing query and can make analysis of query sentences as far as statement and then generates the SQL statement and query from the database. It simply accepts query sentences inputs and then inference possible. This translation system supports users to understand SQL through the lexicon database in order to produce the SQL string outputs. The system is intended to query information in middle school. They can get efficient result by using the English Language query without the knowledge of SQL language. The purpose of this thesis is to construct the query translation system from natural language to SQL. Visual Studio 2005. This system is implemented by using SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.",
